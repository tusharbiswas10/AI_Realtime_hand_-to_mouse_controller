# AI_Realtime_hand_-to_mouse_controller
An AI-based mouse controller using hand gesture recognition. This project aims to enhance the user's experience by providing a hands-free way of controlling their computer's mouse cursor.
The system will use the webcam to detect hand landmarks, track the movements of the hand, and perform clicking actions based on the positions of these landmarks.
